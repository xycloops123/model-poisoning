## Model Poisoning Workshop

This repository contains the code and materials for the Model Poisoning Workshop. The workshop is designed to introduce participants to the concept of model poisoning attacks and how they can be used to manipulate the behavior of machine learning models. The workshop will cover the basics of model poisoning attacks, including how they work and how they can be used to manipulate the behavior of machine learning models. Participants will also have the opportunity to experiment with model poisoning attacks in a hands-on environment.
